- 👋 Hi, I’m @AMazda07
- //Mazda is Persian word, means: "the one&only" it is the attribute of ancient God in old Persia; the full name is Ahura Mazda 'the one and only God'- I have chosen "A Mazda" as a name for myself, cause I guess there is one&only person in the universe with my mind-map as there is only one person like each of 8billion "HomoSapiens" living on the earth... and also I love the meaning and tone ;) -- about the number '07', it is my lucky number and also it is my number when I used to play basketball...
- 👀 I’m interested in one word I should say: "Cognitive-Science" - specially where Neuroscience & Machines meet eachother.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Chinese language as my third language after that I'm gonna learn Arabic - I'm working on neuroscience and very interested on the approach of Numenta company and Jeff Hawkins to reach to a true AGI(Artificial General Intelligence)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reaching to a true AGI.
